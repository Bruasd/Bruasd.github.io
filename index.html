        • Abstract: While advantageous in full-arch implant dentistry, intraoral scanning suffers from cumulative errors
        during sequential scan merging, making the measurement error exceed the acceptable thresholding. This study
        proposes a novel ”segment-match-correct” robotic process automation workflow employing 3D registration
        algorithms to enhance implant positioning accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the impact of scanning errors
        on the workflow was investigated by simulating four distinct noise types. The proposed method significantly
        reduced dentist workload while achieving a reduced linear error, surpassing conventional intraoral scan accuracy.
        Noise simulations confirmed the error sources.<br>
        • Publication: An Automated Post-Processing Workflow for Improving the Full-arch Intraoral Measurement of
        Implants (First Author, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement).<br>
        • Stack: Python, Point cloud, 3D registration, CAD, Robotic process automation
